# Flood Risk Assessment of Pudding Brooke: Utilizing Topography Analysis for Informed Decision Making

To comprehensively assess the flood risk of Pudding Brooke, we employed Digital Terrain Model LIDAR tiles in QGIS to generate contour polygons at 0.25m intervals. These polygons were then color-coded based on elevation, providing a clear visualization of the area's topography and highlighting potential flood-prone zones.

A crucial aspect of the flood risk assessment was the identification of suitable locations for outbuildings. Our objective was to ensure that any new structures would be strategically positioned on high ground, minimizing their vulnerability to flooding. Through a meticulous examination of the contour polygons, we selected appropriate sites situated on the highest available ground.

By leveraging Digital Terrain Model LIDAR tiles and contour polygons, we obtained accurate flood risk assessments and made informed decisions about the placement of outbuildings. This meticulous topography analysis allowed us to safeguard new structures from potential flooding, ensuring the safety and resilience of developments in Pudding Brooke.
