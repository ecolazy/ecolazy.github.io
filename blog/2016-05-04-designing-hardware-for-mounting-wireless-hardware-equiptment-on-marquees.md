# Enhancing Wireless Connectivity on Outdoor Marquees: An Innovative Hardware Design
We have devised an ingenious hardware system to facilitate the mounting of wireless access points and point-to-point links on the aluminum extrusion structural elements of outdoor event marquees. This groundbreaking method employs a specially designed keeder rail that revolutionizes the process.

The keeder rail is ingeniously crafted to accommodate a cylindrical metal piece, featuring a strategically drilled threaded hole perpendicular to its length. Securing this metal piece in place is effortless, thanks to a large, flat disk with a threaded hole at its center. A simple turn of the disk firmly locks the metal piece, providing a reliable foundation for the installation.

A vital element of this system is the pipe clamp, precisely tailored to fit standard aluminum poles. Utilizing two clamps per pole, we ensure the poles are securely anchored vertically on the side of the tent. This innovative approach guarantees stable connectivity throughout events, without compromising the marquees' aesthetic integrity.

With this hardware design, we aim to enhance wireless connectivity in outdoor settings, providing seamless and secure communication during various events while seamlessly blending with the overall marquee aesthetics. Our cutting-edge solution opens new possibilities for event organizers, ensuring a reliable and visually pleasing wireless experience for attendees.
