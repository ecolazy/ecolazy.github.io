# Efficient Network Hardware Asset Management at the Isle of Wight Festival

The Isle of Wight Festival 2019, held at Seaclose Park, was a massive event with sprawling arenas and fields covering 3km. The deployment of the network infrastructure was a complex undertaking to ensure seamless connectivity across the site. To achieve this, network cabinets were strategically set up in each arena, interconnected with miles of fiber optic cables. These cabinets were further linked to multiple bonded ADSL connections, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.

To extend connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were positioned within 100 meters of the cabinets. Areas beyond this range were connected using wireless point-to-point links, mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beamed across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. At distant locations, wireless point-to-point receivers were attached to the sides of tents to capture these signals.

Besides the network infrastructure, a comprehensive CCTV system was crucial for ensuring attendee safety. To achieve this, each arena was equipped with at least one cherry picker, hosting a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera. Additional cameras were installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, while temporary offices were equipped with WiFi and VoIP phones for efficient internal and external communication.

To facilitate the deployment and management of the network, we employed various tools and resources. For instance, we utilized QGIS's 'Align Raster' tool to georeference a high-definition site map image, which was then uploaded to Mapbox to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This web map utilized the host phone's geolocation to position markers, aiding in identifying the exact location of tents requiring connectivity. We also utilized the 'Map Marker' app on Android to rapidly locate and deploy network devices.

After the event, the map proved invaluable in locating and retrieving all equipment. This was especially helpful as the staff members responsible for investigating faults or retrieving hardware were often different from those who deployed them, making it challenging to locate devices without an updated map showing their precise locations and connections. By utilizing this map, we efficiently traced faults in the network and ensured that all equipment was accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and intricate endeavor, contributing to the smooth operation of the event.
