# From Legacy to Innovation: A Journey in Architecture and Green Building

Throughout my architectural journey, I have been shaped by a multitude of experiences and inspirations that have led me to my chosen field of study. One of my greatest influences is my great grandfather, Sir Ove Arup, whose legacy profoundly impacted me. Witnessing the thin shell structures featured in the Arup Journal ignited my fascination for these architectural marvels. Building countless woven hazel frames further deepened my appreciation for unique structures, and I also explored traditional wooden boat building, captivated by the artistry of the craft.

Driven by the dream of building my own home on a piece of land in the garden, I drew inspiration from Lloyd Kahn's book, "Shelter." With friends, we embarked on the ambitious project of excavating a 14-meter long tunnel into the hillside, using stones sourced from the garden. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete to ensure stability, transforming our vision into a reality.

Recognizing the significance of understanding materials in architecture, I pursued hands-on experience. I attended a year-long course in fine joinery and followed it with a two-year apprenticeship in stone masonry. Additionally, I explored steel fabrication through a separate course, expanding my skills and knowledge.

My interest in aquaponics and domestic food production led me to extensive research on ecological system engineering, particularly the work of the New Alchemy Institute. Spirulina, a microalgae with exceptional nutritional benefits, intrigued me, and I explored ways to integrate photo bioreactors into buildings for sustainable food production.

Through creative exploration, I used SketchUp to document the construction of a pottery shed, and together with friends, we built an oak-framed building set into the hillside over the course of a year. My passion for boats led me to collaborate with a Canadian theatre company, contributing to ship repairs and creating scene-by-scene drawings for rigging procedures.

Seeking a deeper understanding of building technologies and structural elements, I established a personal studio. Utilizing color-coded material selection charts and exploring form-finding software, computational geometry, and fabric formed plaster, I created physical models of various structures. Additionally, I delved into technologies for energy efficiency and cost reduction in building materials.

Although I have enjoyed working as a part-time stonemason, I am eager to further expand my knowledge through a university education. My interest lies in understanding the functional technologies of buildings before exploring sociological and aesthetic considerations, ultimately shaping my future architectural practice.

Currently, I have two distinct streams of interest: thin shell structures, inspired by my great grandfather's work and my experiences with woven hazel branches, and a broader fascination with arranging elements efficiently to meet occupants' needs with minimal energy consumption, influenced by figures like Buckminster Fuller and principles of permaculture. I am in the process of organizing my research into meaningful forms, creating interconnected systems maps, and quantifying their relationships. My vision is to design buildings that embody these innovative approaches.

My passion lies in researching green building technologies, delving into the intricate physics of these systems. As I grasp the fundamental workings intuitively, I enjoy creating diagrams that visually represent the technology in an accessible manner. Using color-coded material property charts, I enhance my understanding and allow myself to explore this information imaginatively.

Crafting pictorial flow diagrams that document the fusion and evolution of design concepts brings me great joy. These diagrams become a web of interconnected ideas, from which intriguing concepts can be extracted and expanded into three-dimensional forms. This transformative process involves further refinements and adjustments to create refined designs.

The most captivating aspect of this functional design process is the emergence of peculiar aesthetics. Beyond mere functionality, the creations exude a unique and striking visual appeal. An example of such a conceptual autonomous building is depicted here, born from this very design process. This building features a magnificent piece of parabolically curved stainless steel with a dual purpose. Firstly, it collects rainwater, and secondly, it concentrates all rooftop solar irradiance into a single sheet of brilliant light. As this radiant light passes through the center of the building, it illuminates and energizes the interior rooms. Finally, it proceeds to the basement, where it gently heats a substantial volume of water and supports various waste treatment bioreactors.
