## Harmony of Natural Building Materials: A Journey of Exploration and Inspiration

In architectural design, a nuanced understanding of materials can elevate a project from functional to sublime. This philosophy guided my quest to explore and celebrate natural building materials like stone, wood, and mud. The goal was to resonate with each material's inherent qualities, and this undertaking became a profound journey of exploration and inspiration.

I began by contemplating the landscape where these materials are naturally abundant. In a cross-sectional view, stone is the essence of the subterranean, water-rich world, whereas wood represents the surface and the elevated, air-filled spaces. This exploration was not purely conceptual; it led me to create lightweight hazel structures that capture the ethereal aspects of wood and air, giving me a deeper appreciation for these elements. This experience piqued my curiosity about the stone's realm, prompting an ambitious excavation into a hillside. Though the endeavor was challenging and fell short of discovering any vast caverns, it was an adventure that added texture to my understanding of natural materials.

When structural concerns demanded the addition of concrete load-bearing walls in the tunnel, I felt we lost some of the raw, rustic aesthetics I initially envisioned. Despite this, the process was invaluable for understanding the limits and possibilities of natural materials. 

Between the layers of stone and wood in my design, I imagined a thin layer of mud, a material that, though less explored, plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem. Its potential as a building material is intriguing and deserves further study, which I touch upon in the design section of my project.

In translating these insights into a functional design, I envisioned the wood layer as the ideal setting for sleeping quarters, offering a dry, warm loft space. The middle layer, the ground floor, is designed for the kitchen, toilet, and other functional spaces. Beneath it all, I left room for a subterranean space crafted from stone, its purpose still open to exploration.

This design journey has been more than an architectural project; it has been a holistic experience that deepened my relationship with the natural world. By harmoniously integrating these elements, I believe we can create buildings that are not just structures but soulful habitats.
