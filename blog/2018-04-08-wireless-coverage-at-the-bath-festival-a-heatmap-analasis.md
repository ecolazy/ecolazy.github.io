# Optimizing Wireless Connectivity at the Bath Festival - A Heatmap Analysis

During the Bath Festival, our team strategically deployed access points to offer WiFi connectivity to event attendees. To ensure widespread and dependable coverage, each access point was connected to a sector on an adjacent building via a point-to-point wireless link. In addition to this, we established dual Internet connections for each access point, combining an ADSL line and a temporary satellite on the roof to provide redundancy and seamless connectivity.

To evaluate the performance of the access points and identify any areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots, we conducted a thorough geolocated signal strength analysis using an Android app. The collected data points were organized in Excel and then imported into ArcGIS, where we generated a comprehensive heat map. This heat map was superimposed on the site plan, offering a visual representation of signal strength throughout the festival grounds.

Through careful analysis of the data, we successfully pinpointed areas with weaker signals or potential black spots. Armed with this valuable insight, we took proactive measures to enhance coverage in these areas, ensuring that festival attendees could seamlessly access the WiFi network throughout the entire event. The combination of point-to-point wireless links, ADSL lines, and temporary satellite connections allowed us to deliver a reliable and robust Internet experience to all festival-goers, catering to their connectivity needs in a dynamic and redundant manner.
