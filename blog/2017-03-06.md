# Sustainable Salad Bars Through Vertical Farming

We've designed a self-sufficient salad bar that leverages vertical farming to meet its produce needs. The system employs a rotating mat, reinforced with steel cables, that hangs vertically and is supported by two large drums. Seedlings are planted at the bottom, and by the time they rotate to the top and back down, they are ready for harvest. This allows for a continuous supply of fresh produce.

To nourish the plants, an ultrasonic fog delivers dissolved nutrients in a chamber between the planting surfaces. For climate control, a vertical poly tunnel is proposed in colder settings to regulate temperature.

This innovative approach aims to fulfill fresh produce demands sustainably and could reshape how food establishments source their greens.
