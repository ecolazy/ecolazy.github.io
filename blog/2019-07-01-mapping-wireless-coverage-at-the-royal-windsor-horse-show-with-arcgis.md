# Improving Wireless Connectivity at the Royal Windsor Horse Show using ArcGIS

The Royal Windsor Horse Show, the largest outdoor horse show in the United Kingdom, attracts thousands of visitors each year. To ensure the event's success, providing reliable connectivity to staff and trader areas is of utmost importance.

To achieve this goal, our team implemented a robust wireless network across the show grounds and utilized ArcGIS to create a comprehensive heat map. This heat map was generated by collecting geolocated signal strength readings from smartphones all over the site. The data was then analyzed and visualized in ArcGIS, revealing areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots.

To further enhance our understanding of the network's performance, we overlayed the heat map on a georeferenced site map. This site map showcased the precise locations of wireless access points, cable routes, and network switch points. This integration of data helped us identify potential network issues and make informed decisions to optimize connectivity for the staff and trader areas.

Thanks to this meticulous planning and deployment, the wireless network at the Royal Windsor Horse Show operated flawlessly. It played a pivotal role in ensuring smooth operations during the event, meeting the connectivity needs of staff and traders alike. We take pride in our contribution to the event's success and in supporting the seamless communication and operations throughout the prestigious Royal Windsor Horse Show.
