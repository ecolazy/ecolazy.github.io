# Building as Ecosystem: A Symbiotic Habitat for Inhabitants
In modern architecture, we propose viewing a building not just as a structure but as a living system that interacts harmoniously with its occupants. This approach allows us to design buildings that are not only dynamic but also contribute to the well-being of the people living or working in them.

By incorporating various living organisms into the design, we unlock numerous possibilities. For example, microalgae can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production, while vermicomposting enriches soil. Other elements like fish and plants can contribute to food production and air purification, respectively.

The building serves as a frame or habitat, accommodating these different organisms in specialized environments. By carefully selecting organisms suited to their specific roles, we can create a contained, self-sustaining ecosystem. This design brings various benefits to the building's inhabitants, such as improved air quality and efficient waste management.

In sum, when we treat a building as a living system that fosters a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we pave the way for designs that are dynamic, self-sufficient, and beneficial to human health.
