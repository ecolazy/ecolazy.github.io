            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The primary aim of this design endeavor is to create a comprehensive and functional architectural concept that fulfills all the occupant's needs. My goal is to understand the inner workings of building systems and explore ways to redesign or integrate them innovatively for improved efficiency. The building's form should be an elegant expression of how I creatively organize these systems. I want these systems to be visible, showcasing the essence of their processes, constructed from materials that truly embody their character.</p><p>Amidst the plethora of available building technologies, I strive to synthesize the minimum necessary elements that perfectly align with the design objectives for each unique building. This synthesis results in harmonious systems that serve their specific purposes flawlessly.</p><p>The initial step in this process involved creating a web diagram, mapping out various ways to integrate different technologies to cater to the occupants' needs. From this web, I derived smaller interconnected groups, or flows, which represent the conceptual frameworks for potential designs. To give these flows a tangible 3D form, I calculated the relative sizes of their components, which often have unique scaling ratios influenced by their arrangement.</p><p>Although the exact 3D arrangement of components has not been defined yet, we can still proceed with rough rules of thumb to scale the parts relative to one another. With these parts scaled between 2D and 3D, we can start crafting 3D conceptual designs. These designs are then subject to aesthetic and ergonomic considerations before entering a feedback loop for detailed analytical predictions of their behavior. Alternatively, we can directly proceed to working models, experimenting with suitable materials to assess their structural and aesthetic properties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for my design approach came from a desire to work with natural building materials. I believed that by truly understanding the unique character and qualities of each material, I could unlock unexplored possibilities. My aim was to connect with the essence of each material and place it thoughtfully within the building's structure. To determine the right placement, I looked at where these materials were naturally found in the landscape.</p><p>In an idealized cross-section of the landscape, stone was predominantly underground, often found in association with water, while wood was abundant on the surface and high in the air. I wanted to sense the mood of these places. Through experimenting with lightweight hazel structures, I gained a better understanding of the combination of wood and air. This sparked my curiosity about the mysterious subterranean realm of stone and water. Consequently, I decided to embark on the adventure of excavating a tunnel into the hillside to explore further. Although my hope was to discover a natural cave, the largest cavity I found was disappointingly small.</p><p>Despite the challenges and moments of fear, the process was enjoyable, and it felt like a genuine adventure. To support the tunnel's roof, we eventually constructed concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels. However, this construction compromised the rustic charm of the tunnel, transforming it into a dark concrete duct and reducing the available space.</p><p>Between the layers of wood and stone, my cross-sectional diagram suggested a third layer: a thin stratum of mud, the source of all life. While I had not thoroughly researched mud as a construction material like the others, I extensively studied its role in supporting organic life. These findings are detailed in the whole design section.</p><p>The light and airy nature of wood led me to envision it as suitable for the sleeping quarters of the building, providing a dry and warm loft area. The middle layer, the ground floor, would accommodate activities related to daily living, including the kitchen, toilet, and spaces for organic activities and food production. Finally, I envisioned subterranean stone cavernous spaces beneath the building, their purpose yet to be determined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

To this end, our team combined three separate files containing price paid data into a single file and cleaned and filtered the data through a series of steps. These steps included the removal of quotes, the selection of only rows with "GL" followed by a number, the printing of certain columns, the addition of column names, and the deletion of rows with null values.</p><p>Once the data was cleaned and organized, we used the powerful tool ogr2ogr to convert a file with cadastral parcel information into a PostgreSQL file. We then changed the projection from OSGB to WGS84 and imported it into a database. In order to store the data in a structured manner, we started a psql session and created empty tables with certain columns in the database.</p><p>Next, we used the \copy command and SQL JOIN to combine the price and coordinates data based on their shared postcodes. We added a column for geometry data and used the latitude and longitude data to create points. We then calculated the average value for each of the duplicate polygons.</p><p>Finally, we used the powerful mapping software QGIS to export the table from the database and modified the layer properties for visual appeal. Through this process, we were able to effectively organize and analyze the real estate data, allowing us to extract valuable insights and gain a deeper understanding of the market.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/price-paid-parcel-b58fdcacf1b5265bca273e23e59ebb2e.jpg" width="1534" height="787" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>During our analysis of real estate data, we encountered an issue with some of the postal codes not being properly associated with the intended polygons. This issue had the potential to significantly impact the accuracy and usefulness of our data.</p><p>To address this issue and improve the accuracy of our data, we decided to use a different set of polygons (parishes) with a lower resolution for the next project. We hoped that this approach would help to more accurately associate the postal codes with the intended polygons, resulting in a more reliable dataset.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout my architectural journey, I have been shaped by a multitude of experiences and inspirations that have led me to my chosen field of study. One of my greatest influences is my great grandfather, Sir Ove Arup, whose legacy profoundly impacted me. Witnessing the thin shell structures featured in the Arup Journal ignited my fascination for these architectural marvels. Building countless woven hazel frames further deepened my appreciation for unique structures, and I also explored traditional wooden boat building, captivated by the artistry of the craft.</p><p>Driven by the dream of building my own home on a piece of land in the garden, I drew inspiration from Lloyd Kahn's book, "Shelter." With friends, we embarked on the ambitious project of excavating a 14-meter long tunnel into the hillside, using stones sourced from the garden. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete to ensure stability, transforming our vision into a reality.</p><p>Recognizing the significance of understanding materials in architecture, I pursued hands-on experience. I attended a year-long course in fine joinery and followed it with a two-year apprenticeship in stone masonry. Additionally, I explored steel fabrication through a separate course, expanding my skills and knowledge.</p><p>My interest in aquaponics and domestic food production led me to extensive research on ecological system engineering, particularly the work of the New Alchemy Institute. Spirulina, a microalgae with exceptional nutritional benefits, intrigued me, and I explored ways to integrate photo bioreactors into buildings for sustainable food production.</p><p>Through creative exploration, I used SketchUp to document the construction of a pottery shed, and together with friends, we built an oak-framed building set into the hillside over the course of a year. My passion for boats led me to collaborate with a Canadian theatre company, contributing to ship repairs and creating scene-by-scene drawings for rigging procedures.</p><p>Seeking a deeper understanding of building technologies and structural elements, I established a personal studio. Utilizing color-coded material selection charts and exploring form-finding software, computational geometry, and fabric formed plaster, I created physical models of various structures. Additionally, I delved into technologies for energy efficiency and cost reduction in building materials.</p><p>Although I have enjoyed working as a part-time stonemason, I am eager to further expand my knowledge through a university education. My interest lies in understanding the functional technologies of buildings before exploring sociological and aesthetic considerations, ultimately shaping my future architectural practice.</p><p>Currently, I have two distinct streams of interest: thin shell structures, inspired by my great grandfather's work and my experiences with woven hazel branches, and a broader fascination with arranging elements efficiently to meet occupants' needs with minimal energy consumption, influenced by figures like Buckminster Fuller and principles of permaculture. I am in the process of organizing my research into meaningful forms, creating interconnected systems maps, and quantifying their relationships. My vision is to design buildings that embody these innovative approaches.</p><p>My passion lies in researching green building technologies, delving into the intricate physics of these systems. As I grasp the fundamental workings intuitively, I enjoy creating diagrams that visually represent the technology in an accessible manner. Using color-coded material property charts, I enhance my understanding and allow myself to explore this information imaginatively.</p><p>Crafting pictorial flow diagrams that document the fusion and evolution of design concepts brings me great joy. These diagrams become a web of interconnected ideas, from which intriguing concepts can be extracted and expanded into three-dimensional forms. This transformative process involves further refinements and adjustments to create refined designs.</p><p>The most captivating aspect of this functional design process is the emergence of peculiar aesthetics. Beyond mere functionality, the creations exude a unique and striking visual appeal. An example of such a conceptual autonomous building is depicted here, born from this very design process. This building features a magnificent piece of parabolically curved stainless steel with a dual purpose. Firstly, it collects rainwater, and secondly, it concentrates all rooftop solar irradiance into a single sheet of brilliant light. As this radiant light passes through the center of the building, it illuminates and energizes the interior rooms. Finally, it proceeds to the basement, where it gently heats a substantial volume of water and supports various waste treatment bioreactors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ordnance Survey Mastermap Topography Layer, Building Height Attribute (BHA), and Environment Agency LiDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) are valuable data sources that enable the creation of 3D models of buildings. By leveraging this data and utilizing the Qgis2ThreeJS plugin in QGIS, we can visualize the BHA data in 3D and generate detailed building models.</p><p>To begin, install the Qgis2ThreeJS plugin and load the BHA data, DTM data, and any other desired layers into the QGIS project. Utilizing the plugin, customize the styling of the BHA data and define the height attribute for extrusion, which results in a realistic 3D representation of the building. This 3D model can be saved as an HTML file and effortlessly viewed in a web browser.</p><p>The inclusion of the LiDAR DTM enhances the accuracy of the 3D model, and it can also be opened in Grasshopper, a visual programming language and environment within the Rhinoceros 3D CAD application. By incorporating the Ladybug plugin, this 3D model becomes a powerful tool for conducting in-depth climate analyses and generating interactive visualizations for environmentally-informed design, including sunlight studies.</p><p>Through this integrated approach, we can harness the potential of spatial data and advanced visualization tools to create sophisticated 3D models that facilitate informed decision-making in architectural and environmental design.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/bha-1-43f5d793112b5e7d965dd45b486ad82e.png" width="849" height="519" class="img_ev3q">

The stage needed to meet several requirements: it had to have a 6-meter diameter, be easily disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a 2.6-meter-wide door, support the weight of performers, be quickly assembled by two people (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), remain flat and level on rough terrain, and withstand the rough handling and moisture typically encountered in circus life.</p><p>To achieve these goals, we explored various designs for the circular stage and ultimately settled on a composite panel construction. Each panel was made with an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fiberglass, coated with a non-slip surface. The material was shaped using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam from the mating edges was removed, leaving only the outer fiberglass material. Aluminum extrusions were then pressed into the edges of the panels, providing protection, supporting the edges to prevent deflection, and creating slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.</p><p>The leg structures were positioned at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels, welded at 120-degree intervals to form a three-directional cross. A threaded tube was left at the intersection, into which a bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom could be threaded. This allowed for easy adjustment of the legs from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. The quick and simple assembly process involved extending the legs until they touched the ground to level the stage. Inner steel box sections curved along the outer edges of the panels held the pieces together, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.</p><p>Overall, the design and construction of the circular stage were challenging yet rewarding. We successfully met all the client's requirements, creating a durable, stable, and easily assembled stage that could withstand the demands of circus performances.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-7-536a8dc3915c3bc552fc3a732e057602.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-8-27308a0483995332cca67e02fbdec9fc.jpg" width="1058" height="752" class="img_ev3q">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this project, our aim was to successfully install and configure the Cisco Catalyst c9800-CL wireless controller using Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). The c9800-CL is a powerful and flexible cloud-based wireless controller capable of managing both on-premises and cloud-based wireless networks. It belongs to the Cisco Catalyst 9800 series and offers a range of advanced features, such as wireless intrusion prevention, location services, and guest access.</p><p>To begin, we installed virtualization software and enabled the libvirtd service on our system. This allowed us to create and manage virtual machines using KVM. We then created a network bridge using the brctl command, enabling communication between the virtual machine and the host system.</p><p>With the necessary infrastructure in place, we used the virt-install command to install the c9800-CL on a new virtual machine. During the installation process, we specified several options, such as the connection to the virtualization server, the operating system variant, the architecture of the virtual machine, and the CPU type.</p><p>Once the virtual machine was set up and the c9800-CL was installed, we provided a script to configure the controller. This script contained a series of steps necessary to properly set up the c9800-CL. These steps included setting the hostname, creating a user account, configuring the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, creating a VLAN, setting up static routes, shutting down and re-enabling the radio frequencies, and setting the country code. We also configured the virtual wireless LAN controller (VWLC) and set the DNS and NTP servers to ensure proper network connectivity and synchronization.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated how to access the GUI of the c9800-CL at the specified IP address and walked through the zero-day configuration steps to set up a wireless network. By following these steps, users can easily configure the c9800-CL to meet the specific needs of their wireless network.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Isle of Wight Festival 2019, held at Seaclose Park, was a massive event with sprawling arenas and fields covering 3km. The deployment of the network infrastructure was a complex undertaking to ensure seamless connectivity across the site. To achieve this, network cabinets were strategically set up in each arena, interconnected with miles of fiber optic cables. These cabinets were further linked to multiple bonded ADSL connections, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.</p><p>To extend connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were positioned within 100 meters of the cabinets. Areas beyond this range were connected using wireless point-to-point links, mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beamed across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. At distant locations, wireless point-to-point receivers were attached to the sides of tents to capture these signals.</p><p>Besides the network infrastructure, a comprehensive CCTV system was crucial for ensuring attendee safety. To achieve this, each arena was equipped with at least one cherry picker, hosting a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera. Additional cameras were installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, while temporary offices were equipped with WiFi and VoIP phones for efficient internal and external communication.</p><p>To facilitate the deployment and management of the network, we employed various tools and resources. For instance, we utilized QGIS's 'Align Raster' tool to georeference a high-definition site map image, which was then uploaded to Mapbox to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This web map utilized the host phone's geolocation to position markers, aiding in identifying the exact location of tents requiring connectivity. We also utilized the 'Map Marker' app on Android to rapidly locate and deploy network devices.</p><p>After the event, the map proved invaluable in locating and retrieving all equipment. This was especially helpful as the staff members responsible for investigating faults or retrieving hardware were often different from those who deployed them, making it challenging to locate devices without an updated map showing their precise locations and connections. By utilizing this map, we efficiently traced faults in the network and ensured that all equipment was accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and intricate endeavor, contributing to the smooth operation of the event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our web application provides users with access to live network device data and the ability to update device locations. When a device's location needs recording, users simply input the device's MAC address into the app. The app checks the MAC address against a list of available device MAC addresses in the database to ensure authenticity. If the MAC address is verified, it is marked as "deployed," and the user's phone coordinates (from the update) are added to the latitude and longitude columns. In case of an incorrect MAC address or one not matching any device in the database, the user is notified and prompted to enter a different MAC address.</p><p>Deployed devices are dynamically displayed on a real-time map, enabling users to easily view and locate them. Clicking on a device reveals detailed information such as device type, MAC address, IP address, and more. Additionally, users can select a device for deletion, updating the corresponding value in the "deployment status" column to "false" and removing latitude and longitude position data from the database.</p><p>For app testing and debugging purposes, we designed a BASH script to generate synthetic data. This script produces a CSV file with random MAC addresses, asset tags, device models, and locations, facilitating easy testing by uploading the data to the database. By using this script, we simulated various scenarios to ensure the app's functionality before deploying it in a live environment.</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

To ensure widespread and dependable coverage, each access point was connected to a sector on an adjacent building via a point-to-point wireless link. In addition to this, we established dual Internet connections for each access point, combining an ADSL line and a temporary satellite on the roof to provide redundancy and seamless connectivity.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the access points and identify any areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots, we conducted a thorough geolocated signal strength analysis using an Android app. The collected data points were organized in Excel and then imported into ArcGIS, where we generated a comprehensive heat map. This heat map was superimposed on the site plan, offering a visual representation of signal strength throughout the festival grounds.</p><p>Through careful analysis of the data, we successfully pinpointed areas with weaker signals or potential black spots. Armed with this valuable insight, we took proactive measures to enhance coverage in these areas, ensuring that festival attendees could seamlessly access the WiFi network throughout the entire event. The combination of point-to-point wireless links, ADSL lines, and temporary satellite connections allowed us to deliver a reliable and robust Internet experience to all festival-goers, catering to their connectivity needs in a dynamic and redundant manner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GIS software serves as an invaluable tool in our quest to identify optimal areas for building development. One effective method involves importing topographic polygons from OS MasterMap into the software and utilizing the buffer tool to generate delineations around these polygons. This process enables us to visualize permitted development zones based on various zoning and regulatory constraints.</p><p>For instance, in areas designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), specific rules apply to outbuildings. Outbuildings with a floor area exceeding 10m2 must be situated within 20 meters of the main dwelling house. To pinpoint suitable locations for compliant outbuildings, we create a buffer zone with a radius of 20 meters around the main dwelling house polygon. This delineates the area where outbuildings may be constructed in adherence to regulations.</p><p>Moreover, if the proposed outbuilding is within 2 meters of the property boundary, its overall height is limited to 2.4 meters. To identify the most suitable area that meets these criteria, we create a buffer around the property boundary using the buffer tool. The overlapping area between the buffer around the dwelling house and the inverse of the buffer around the property boundary defines the permissible zone for building an outbuilding with a pitched roof up to 4 meters tall (with an eaves height of 2.5 meters) or a flat roof up to 3 meters tall.</p><p>By harnessing the power of these GIS tools, we effectively and accurately identify the prime areas for building development. This streamlined site analysis approach empowers us to make well-informed decisions, ensuring compliance with regulations and maximizing the potential of each project.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/permitted-development-229c7618b9d11677141f5f9adf4bbe51.jpg" width="641" height="523" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the idea of incorporating natural building materials, we embarked on a journey to explore the distinctive qualities and essence of each material, aiming to utilize them in innovative ways within our design. Our endeavor was to capture the ambiance and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials typically thrive – whether it be the subterranean realm of stone and water or the ethereal heights of wood.</p><p>To achieve this vision, we conducted experiments with lightweight hazel structures to blend the elements of wood and air seamlessly into our design. Our particular interest led us to the world below, where we decided to excavate a tunnel into the side of a hill, hoping to uncover new possibilities. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we encountered was merely two feet wide, prompting us to devise an alternative solution to support the tunnel's roof. Ultimately, we opted for concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels to bolster the stone above, although it did compromise some of the original rustic charm of our concept, safety became the priority.</p><p>Our cross-sectional diagram revealed an additional layer between stone and wood in our design – a slender stratum of mud, the wellspring of all life. Though we have yet to delve extensively into using mud as a construction material, we extensively researched and explored its role in supporting organic life. Envisioning the wood as an ideal space for sleeping quarters, offering warmth and comfort in the loft, we allocated the ground floor for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. Additionally, we envisaged the possibility of incorporating a subterranean stone cavernous space beneath the building, its purpose yet to be determined.</p><p>Overall, the central focus of this project was to employ natural building materials in innovative and distinctive ways, capturing the spirit and ambiance of the natural environments where these materials are intrinsically connected. Although we faced challenges throughout this creative process, it proved to be an exhilarating and gratifying experience, culminating in a design we take great pride in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Our team has an innovative idea for a self-sustaining salad bar that utilizes vertical space to meet production needs. We propose planting seedlings in a steel cable reinforced fiber matting that hangs vertically above the counter. This matting would be supported by two large drums at the top and bottom, and would be able to rotate at a speed calculated based on the height of the assembly, the maturation time of the chosen crop, and the desired harvesting frequency. This way, a seedling planted at the bottom would be ready for harvest by the time it reaches the top and returns to the bottom. With this system, the salad bar would be able to achieve perpetual harvesting, meeting its demand for fresh produce without having to rely on traditional terrestrial agriculture methods.]]></description>

This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Overall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce.</p>]]></content:encoded>
