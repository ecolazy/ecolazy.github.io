# Optimized Design for Modern Motor Caravans: Blending Comfort and Function

Our mission in designing for small spaces goes beyond mere functionality; we aim to enhance the overall well-being of users. To achieve this, we've developed a space that perfectly marries comfort and practicality.

For structural integrity and insulation, we chose a layer of spray foam, shaped and refined with acrylic putty. This lightweight yet robust material ensures a cozy interior. Within this space, we created an efficient layout featuring a lengthwise single bed parallel to a desk, maximizing utility in a confined space. Additionally, we designed a path that allows free movement from the back of the caravan to the side door.

We've also included a fully equipped kitchen area with features like a water-saving faucet and a full-size fridge, catering to all cooking and storage needs. To control light and maintain privacy, the caravan is outfitted with double-layered blackout blinds and windows.

In summary, this space offers a balanced blend of comfort and functionality.
