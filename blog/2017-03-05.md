## Innovative Uses of Natural Materials in Architecture
We set out to explore the unique characteristics of natural building materials and how they could be incorporated into architectural designs that reflect the essence of their natural settings. Our goal was to merge the elemental qualities of materials like stone, wood, and mud in innovative ways.

In our experiments, we explored lightweight hazel structures to integrate the elements of wood and air into our design. While initially aiming to dig a tunnel into a hillside, safety concerns led us to use concrete blocks as load-bearing walls, without losing sight of our original rustic concept.

Our design includes a layer of mud situated between stone and wood, serving as a bridge between these elements and underscoring mud's role in supporting organic life. The upper wooden layer is designed as a cozy sleeping loft, while the ground floor accommodates functional spaces like a kitchen and bathroom. We also considered adding a subterranean stone chamber for future purposes.

Despite challenges, our focus remained on creatively using natural materials to capture the atmosphere of the environments where these materials are found. The project became an enriching experience, resulting in a design that embodies the unique characteristics of each natural element.
