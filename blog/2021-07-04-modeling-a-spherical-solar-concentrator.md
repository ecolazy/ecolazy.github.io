# Modeling a Spherical Solar Concentrator
![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/solar-concentrator-3.jpg)

If a mirror is positioned on the surface of a sphere and is perpendicular to a line that extends from the center of the sphere to a point on the surface of the sphere, light from outside the sphere that is directed towards the mirror will be reflected off the mirror's surface and into the center of the sphere.

## Background

Solar energy is a renewable energy source that has the potential to meet a significant portion of the world's energy needs. However, solar energy is currently not as widely used as other energy sources due to the difficulty of capturing and concentrating solar energy.


## Abstract

A solar concentrator is provided that uses a sphere with rotating mirrors to concentrate solar energy. The sphere is covered with a plurality of small mirrors, each of which can rotate freely in any direction. Light from outside the sphere that is directed towards any of the mirrors will be reflected off the mirror's surface and into the center of the sphere. The concentrated solar energy can then be used to generate electricity or heat water.

## Description

The solar concentrator comprises a sphere, a plurality of small mirrors, and a support structure. The sphere is covered with the plurality of small mirrors, each of which can rotate freely in any direction. The support structure supports the sphere and maintains it in a fixed position.

The small mirrors can be made of any material that is reflective of sunlight, such as glass, metal, or plastic. The support structure can be made of any material that is strong enough to support the weight of the sphere and that will not corrode in sunlight.

The solar concentrator can be used to generate electricity or heat water. To generate electricity, the concentrated solar energy can be used to heat a fluid, such as water or molten salt. The heated fluid can then be used to drive a turbine, which can generate electricity. To heat water, the concentrated solar energy can be used to heat water directly. The heated water can then be used for bathing, cooking, or other purposes.

## Advantages

The solar concentrator using a sphere with rotating mirrors has several advantages over other solar concentrators. First, the rotating mirrors are able to reflect sunlight from a wide range of angles, which makes it more efficient at capturing solar energy. Second, the rotating mirrors are able to concentrate solar energy into a small area, which makes it more efficient at generating electricity or heating water. Third, the rotating mirrors are relatively easy to manufacture and install, which makes it a cost-effective option for solar energy applications.

## Claims

A solar concentrator comprising:
a sphere;
a plurality of small mirrors; and
a support structure.
The sphere is covered with the plurality of small mirrors, each of which can rotate freely in any direction.
The support structure supports the sphere and maintains it in a fixed position.
The small mirrors are made of a material that is reflective of sunlight.
The support structure is made of a material that is strong enough to support the weight of the sphere and that will not corrode in sunlight.
The solar concentrator is used to generate electricity.
The solar concentrator is used to heat water.


## Conclusion

The solar concentrator using a sphere with rotating mirrors is a novel and efficient way to capture and concentrate solar energy. The concentrator has several advantages over other solar concentrators, including its ability to reflect sunlight from a wide range of angles, its ability to concentrate solar energy into a small area, and its relatively easy manufacture and installation. The concentrator has the potential to be a cost-effective option for solar energy applications.
