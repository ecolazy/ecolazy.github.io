## Streamlining Wireless Set-Up on Outdoor Tents: A Novel Hardware Approach
We've developed a smart hardware solution for easy mounting of wireless devices on the structural components of outdoor event tents. Our novel approach uses a custom-designed rail system for easy attachment.

The rail is specifically designed to hold a cylindrical metal piece with a strategically placed threaded hole. A large, flat disk with a threaded hole in the center is used to effortlessly lock this piece in place, creating a stable foundation for wireless equipment.

Our system also incorporates custom pipe clamps that fit standard tent poles. By using two clamps per pole, we guarantee secure vertical anchoring without sacrificing the tent's appearance.

This innovative hardware design aims to elevate outdoor wireless connectivity. It offers event organizers new options for reliable and aesthetically pleasing wireless setups, ensuring a seamless experience for attendees.
