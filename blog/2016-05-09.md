## Bridging Art and Engineering: Crafting a 3D Egg Sculpture with Algorithms
We recently collaborated with an artist on an intriguing task: creating the ideal geometry for a large-scale egg sculpture. Using the generative design tool Grasshopper 3D, we set out to turn this artistic vision into a tangible masterpiece.

Initially, we gathered the essential parameters from the artist, such as the sculpture's dimensions, shape, and materials. Armed with these details, we explored algorithmic methods to generate a variety of geometric options for the sculpture.

Grasshopper 3D allowed us to manipulate geometries based on algorithmic rules. By blending mathematical functions with artistic input, we generated numerous potential shapes for the project.

Our next step was to narrow down these options by evaluating their structural integrity, manufacturability, and aesthetic quality. Both digital simulations and physical prototypes were employed to rigorously test each design.

In the end, we pinpointed the perfect geometry that met all the projectâ€™s criteria. The artist then transformed this geometric blueprint into a remarkable sculpture that captivated public interest.

This project showcases the incredible synergy of art and technology, proving that when creativity collaborates with engineering, the possibilities are endless.
