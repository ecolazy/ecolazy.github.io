# Creating a Living Building: Fostering a Symbiotic Bond with Its Inhabitants

When envisioning a building's design, it is paramount to view it as a living organism, nurturing a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. This entails organizing the building like a system of interdependent entities, each serving a distinct purpose within the broader structure. Embracing the building as an organism allows us to craft a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that enhances the health and well-being of its inhabitants.

Incorporating various organisms into the building's design opens a world of possibilities. Microalgae, for instance, can contribute to wastewater treatment and oxygen production. Vermiculture supports composting and soil enrichment, while fish offer potential for food production and waste management. Guinea pigs can serve as educational research companions, leafy green plants aid in air purification and aesthetics, and bacteria facilitate essential biological processes like fermentation and nutrient cycling.

The building itself acts as a nurturing shell or frame, providing a habitat for these organisms. By employing creatures that are well-suited to their specific environment, distinct systems can be kept separate, effectively establishing an urban jungle within the building's confines. This approach fosters a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, offering a multitude of benefits to its occupants, including enhanced air quality, food production, and waste management. By embracing the building as a living organism with a harmonious bond to its inhabitants, we can create structures that are dynamic, self-sustaining, and profoundly supportive of human health and well-being.
