# Improving Wireless Connectivity  using ArcGIS



To achieve this goal, our team implemented a robust wireless network across the show grounds and utilized ArcGIS to create a comprehensive heat map. This heat map was generated by collecting geolocated signal strength readings from smartphones all over the site. The data was then analyzed and visualized in ArcGIS, revealing areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots.

To further enhance our understanding of the network's performance, we overlayed the heat map on a georeferenced site map. This site map showcased the precise locations of wireless access points, cable routes, and network switch points. This integration of data helped us identify potential network issues and make informed decisions to optimize connectivity for the staff and trader areas.

Thanks to this meticulous planning and deployment, the wireless network operated flawlessly. It played a pivotal role in ensuring smooth operations during the event, meeting the connectivity needs of staff and traders alike. We take pride in our contribution to the event's success and in supporting the seamless communication and operations.
