# Innovative Integration: Crafting Functional Architectural Concepts with Visible Systems
The primary aim of this design endeavor is to create a comprehensive and functional architectural concept that fulfills all the occupant's needs. My goal is to understand the inner workings of building systems and explore ways to redesign or integrate them innovatively for improved efficiency. The building's form should be an elegant expression of how I creatively organize these systems. I want these systems to be visible, showcasing the essence of their processes, constructed from materials that truly embody their character.

Amidst the plethora of available building technologies, I strive to synthesize the minimum necessary elements that perfectly align with the design objectives for each unique building. This synthesis results in harmonious systems that serve their specific purposes flawlessly.

The initial step in this process involved creating a web diagram, mapping out various ways to integrate different technologies to cater to the occupants' needs. From this web, I derived smaller interconnected groups, or flows, which represent the conceptual frameworks for potential designs. To give these flows a tangible 3D form, I calculated the relative sizes of their components, which often have unique scaling ratios influenced by their arrangement.

Although the exact 3D arrangement of components has not been defined yet, we can still proceed with rough rules of thumb to scale the parts relative to one another. With these parts scaled between 2D and 3D, we can start crafting 3D conceptual designs. These designs are then subject to aesthetic and ergonomic considerations before entering a feedback loop for detailed analytical predictions of their behavior. Alternatively, we can directly proceed to working models, experimenting with suitable materials to assess their structural and aesthetic properties.
