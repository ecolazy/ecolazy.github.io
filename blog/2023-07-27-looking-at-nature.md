# Looking at Nature 
The inspiration for my design approach came from a desire to work with natural building materials. I believed that by truly understanding the unique character and qualities of each material, I could unlock unexplored possibilities. My aim was to connect with the essence of each material and place it thoughtfully within the building's structure. To determine the right placement, I looked at where these materials were naturally found in the landscape.

In an idealized cross-section of the landscape, stone was predominantly underground, often found in association with water, while wood was abundant on the surface and high in the air. I wanted to sense the mood of these places. Through experimenting with lightweight hazel structures, I gained a better understanding of the combination of wood and air. This sparked my curiosity about the mysterious subterranean realm of stone and water. Consequently, I decided to embark on the adventure of excavating a tunnel into the hillside to explore further. Although my hope was to discover a natural cave, the largest cavity I found was disappointingly small.

Despite the challenges and moments of fear, the process was enjoyable, and it felt like a genuine adventure. To support the tunnel's roof, we eventually constructed concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels. However, this construction compromised the rustic charm of the tunnel, transforming it into a dark concrete duct and reducing the available space.

Between the layers of wood and stone, my cross-sectional diagram suggested a third layer: a thin stratum of mud, the source of all life. While I had not thoroughly researched mud as a construction material like the others, I extensively studied its role in supporting organic life. These findings are detailed in the whole design section.

The light and airy nature of wood led me to envision it as suitable for the sleeping quarters of the building, providing a dry and warm loft area. The middle layer, the ground floor, would accommodate activities related to daily living, including the kitchen, toilet, and spaces for organic activities and food production. Finally, I envisioned subterranean stone cavernous spaces beneath the building, their purpose yet to be determined.
