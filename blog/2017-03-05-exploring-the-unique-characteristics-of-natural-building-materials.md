# Exploring the Unique Characteristics of Natural Building Materials

Inspired by the idea of incorporating natural building materials, we embarked on a journey to explore the distinctive qualities and essence of each material, aiming to utilize them in innovative ways within our design. Our endeavor was to capture the ambiance and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials typically thrive – whether it be the subterranean realm of stone and water or the ethereal heights of wood.

To achieve this vision, we conducted experiments with lightweight hazel structures to blend the elements of wood and air seamlessly into our design. Our particular interest led us to the world below, where we decided to excavate a tunnel into the side of a hill, hoping to uncover new possibilities. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we encountered was merely two feet wide, prompting us to devise an alternative solution to support the tunnel's roof. Ultimately, we opted for concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels to bolster the stone above, although it did compromise some of the original rustic charm of our concept, safety became the priority.

Our cross-sectional diagram revealed an additional layer between stone and wood in our design – a slender stratum of mud, the wellspring of all life. Though we have yet to delve extensively into using mud as a construction material, we extensively researched and explored its role in supporting organic life. Envisioning the wood as an ideal space for sleeping quarters, offering warmth and comfort in the loft, we allocated the ground floor for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. Additionally, we envisaged the possibility of incorporating a subterranean stone cavernous space beneath the building, its purpose yet to be determined.

Overall, the central focus of this project was to employ natural building materials in innovative and distinctive ways, capturing the spirit and ambiance of the natural environments where these materials are intrinsically connected. Although we faced challenges throughout this creative process, it proved to be an exhilarating and gratifying experience, culminating in a design we take great pride in.
