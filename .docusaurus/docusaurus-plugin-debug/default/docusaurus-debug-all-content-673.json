Environmental monitoring is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the state of the environment, including factors such as air quality, water quality, soil conditions, and wildlife populations. This data is used to understand the impacts of human activities on the environment and to identify and address environmental problems and risks. Environmental monitoring is an important field that plays a key role in protecting the planet and ensuring the sustainability of our natural resources. It helps us to monitor and understand the health of the environment, and to take action to address any issues that may arise. In this section, we will be exploring the various aspects of environmental monitoring, including the different types of data that are collected, the methods and technologies used to gather and analyze this data, and the ways in which the results of environmental monitoring can be used to inform decision-making and policy. By the end of this section, you should have a good understanding of environmental monitoring and its role in protecting the environment.",

From this vantage point, we were able to transmit a strong signal to multiple wireless point-to-point stations attached to temporary structures and buildings within the site. Additionally, we provided indoor wireless coverage in an underground parking garage that served as one of the event venues. To ensure optimal coverage, we created a heat map of the wireless signal strength in this area. Moreover, we established uplinks at various locations throughout the site to support ticket booths, CCTV cameras, payment terminals for bars, a production office, and emergency liaison cabins. Overall, this comprehensive approach to wireless connectivity allowed for seamless communication and connectivity throughout the event.",

From this vantage point, we were able to transmit a strong signal to multiple wireless point-to-point stations attached to temporary structures and buildings within the site. Additionally, we provided indoor wireless coverage in an underground parking garage that served as one of the event venues. To ensure optimal coverage, we created a heat map of the wireless signal strength in this area. Moreover, we established uplinks at various locations throughout the site to support ticket booths, CCTV cameras, payment terminals for bars, a production office, and emergency liaison cabins. Overall, this comprehensive approach to wireless connectivity allowed for seamless communication and connectivity throughout the event."

This is particularly important in the design of motor caravans, which serve as both vehicles and living spaces for travelers. With this in mind, we set out to design a caravan that prioritized both comfort and practicality.\n\nThe first step in our process was to choose the most suitable materials and construction techniques. We decided to use a thick layer of spray foam as the foundation for the caravan's shape, which was then carved back to the desired form and rendered with acrylic putty. This method allowed us to create a strong and lightweight structure, while also providing excellent insulation to keep the interior comfortable.\n\nNext, we focused on the layout of the interior space. We installed a single bed lengthways, with a desk running parallel to it. This arrangement allowed for maximum use of the limited space, while also providing a comfortable and functional sleeping and working area. In addition, we designed the layout in such a way that the user can easily walk from the back of the caravan to the side door unhindered, which gives flexibility in terms of access and egress.\n\nTo ensure practicality, we also included a bulkhead kitchen with a water-saving faucet, a full-size fridge, and a hob. These features allow the user to easily prepare meals and store food while on the road. We also installed double-layered Ikea blackout blinds and windows all around to provide privacy and regulate light and temperature within the caravan.\n\nOverall, our design for this motor caravan prioritizes both comfort and practicality, making it an ideal living space for travelers. By carefully considering the materials, layout, and features, we have created a functional and enjoyable space that will enhance the experience of those who use it.\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-1.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-2.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-3.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-4.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-5.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-6.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-7.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-8.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-9.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-10.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-11.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-12.png)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-13.png)"

To this end, our team combined three separate files containing price paid data into a single file and cleaned and filtered the data through a series of steps. These steps included the removal of quotes, the selection of only rows with \"GL\" followed by a number, the printing of certain columns, the addition of column names, and the deletion of rows with null values.\n\nOnce the data was cleaned and organized, we used the powerful tool ogr2ogr to convert a file with cadastral parcel information into a PostgreSQL file. We then changed the projection from OSGB to WGS84 and imported it into a database. In order to store the data in a structured manner, we started a psql session and created empty tables with certain columns in the database.\n\nNext, we used the \\copy command and SQL JOIN to combine the price and coordinates data based on their shared postcodes. We added a column for geometry data and used the latitude and longitude data to create points. We then calculated the average value for each of the duplicate polygons.\n\nFinally, we used the powerful mapping software QGIS to export the table from the database and modified the layer properties for visual appeal. Through this process, we were able to effectively organize and analyze the real estate data, allowing us to extract valuable insights and gain a deeper understanding of the market.\n\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/price-paid-parcel.jpg)\n\nDuring our analysis of real estate data, we encountered an issue with some of the postal codes not being properly associated with the intended polygons. This issue had the potential to significantly impact the accuracy and usefulness of our data.\n\nTo address this issue and improve the accuracy of our data, we decided to use a different set of polygons (parishes) with a lower resolution for the next project. We hoped that this approach would help to more accurately associate the postal codes with the intended polygons, resulting in a more reliable dataset."

One such request came from an artist who asked us to help find a suitable geometry for a large egg sculpture. Intrigued by the opportunity to collaborate with an artist and apply our skills in a creative context, we set out to identify possible geometries using generative algorithms in Grasshopper 3D.\n\nThe first step in our process was to understand the constraints and requirements of the project. The artist provided us with a set of parameters, including the desired size and shape of the sculpture, as well as the materials that would be used to construct it. With this information in hand, we began to explore different algorithmic approaches that could be used to generate a range of possible geometries.\n\nWe turned to Grasshopper 3D, a powerful tool for generative design that allows users to define and manipulate geometry through a series of algorithmic rules. Using a combination of mathematical functions and input from the artist, we were able to generate a range of potential geometries for the egg sculpture.\n\nTo narrow down our options and select the most suitable geometry, we used a variety of methods to evaluate and compare the different options. We considered factors such as structural integrity, ease of fabrication, and aesthetic appeal, and used computer simulations and physical prototypes to test the performance of the different geometries.\n\nIn the end, we were able to identify a geometry that met all of the requirements and constraints of the project. The artist was pleased with the result and used our geometry to create a stunning egg sculpture that was well-received by the public.\n\nThis project was a rewarding and exciting example of the ways in which engineering and design can intersect with the arts. By using generative algorithms and a collaborative approach, we were able to help an artist realize their vision and create a beautiful work of art.\n\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/egg-1.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/egg-2.jpg)"

It belongs to the Cisco Catalyst 9800 series and offers a range of advanced features such as wireless intrusion prevention, location services, and guest access.\n\nTo begin, we installed virtualization software and enabled the libvirtd service on our system. This allowed us to create and manage virtual machines using KVM. We then created a network bridge using the brctl command, which enabled communication between the virtual machine and the host system.\n\nWith the necessary infrastructure in place, we used the virt-install command to install the c9800-CL on a new virtual machine. During the installation process, we specified a number of options such as the connection to the virtualization server, the operating system variant, the architecture of the virtual machine, and the CPU type.\n\nOnce the virtual machine was set up and the c9800-CL was installed, we provided a script to configure the controller. This script contained a series of steps that were necessary to properly set up the c9800-CL. These steps included setting the hostname, creating a user account, configuring the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, creating a VLAN, setting up static routes, shutting down and re-enabling the radio frequencies, and setting the country code. We also configured the virtual wireless LAN controller (VWLC) and set the DNS and NTP servers to ensure proper network connectivity and synchronization.\n\nFinally, we demonstrated how to access the GUI of the c9800-CL at the specified IP address and walk through the zero-day configuration steps to set up a wireless network. By following these steps, users can easily configure the c9800-CL to meet the specific needs of their wireless network."

A truss is a structural element that consists of a series of interconnected struts, which work together to distribute loads evenly and maintain the stability and strength of the structure. The node we created had 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was attached to the center of one of these faces via a single bolt. This bolt passed through a hole in the center of the end cap of the strut and was secured in place by screwing it into a threaded hole in the center of the dodecahedron face.\n\nThe node was made of steel and was designed to resist the forces transmitted through the truss. Its dodecahedron shape and the use of a single bolt per strut allowed for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, as the struts could be easily rearranged or removed due to their modular design. This feature made the node a crucial element in the overall design of the truss, as it enabled the structure to be easily modified or altered to meet changing needs or requirements.\n\nOverall, the dodecahedron-shaped structural node we created proved to be an effective and efficient solution for joining multiple truss struts together at a single point. It played a vital role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the stability and strength of the truss, and its modular design allowed for flexibility and adaptability in the overall structure.\n\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-1.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-2.jpg)"

The stage had to meet several requirements: it had to have a diameter of 6 meters, be able to be disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a door with a width of 2.6 meters, be able to support the weight of performers, be easy to assemble by two people in a short amount of time (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), be flat and level on rough ground, and be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we considered various designs for the circle and ultimately settled on a composite panel made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fibreglass, with a non-slip coating. The material was cut into the necessary shapes using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam was removed from the mating edges, leaving only the outer fibreglass material. Adhesive was applied and aluminum extrusion was pressed into the edges of the panels. The aluminum provided protection for the edges, supported the edges to prevent deflection, and provided slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.\n\nThe leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels and welded at 120-degree increments to form a three-directional cross. A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a quick and easy assembly process, with the legs being extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. The pieces were held together with inner steel box sections curved on the outer curved edges, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.\n\nOverall, the design and construction of the circular stage was a challenging but rewarding project. We were able to meet all of the requirements set forth by the client and create a stage that was durable, stable, and easy to assemble and transport. \n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-7.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-8.jpg)\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-2.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-6.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-1.jpg)\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-10.jpg)"

In order to ensure that the event runs smoothly, it is important to provide reliable connectivity to the staff and trader areas.\n\nTo achieve this, our team deployed a wireless network on the show grounds and created a heat map by taking geolocated signal strength readings on a smartphone from all over the site. This data was then uploaded into ArcGIS and used to create a heat map, which highlighted areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots.\n\nTo help visualize the network and identify any potential issues, the heat map was overlaid on a georeferenced site map that showed the locations of wireless access points, cable routes, and network switch locations. By using this information, we were able to ensure that the staff and trader areas had the necessary connectivity to support the needs of the event.\n\nOverall, the deployment of the wireless network at the Royal Windsor Horse Show was a success and played a vital role in the smooth running of the event. We are proud to have been able to support the needs of the staff and traders and help make the event a success.\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/windsor-2.png)"

With 3km of arenas and fields to cover, the deployment of the network was a massive and complex undertaking. To ensure that the site was properly connected, network cabinets were set up in each arena and connected with miles of fiber optic cable. These cabinets were then connected to multiple ADSL connections that were bonded together, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.\n\nTo provide connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were located within 100m of the cabinets. Locations that were beyond this range were connected with wireless point-to-point links, which were either mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beam out across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. These signals were then picked up at distant locations through wireless point-to-point receivers attached to the sides of tents.\n\nIn addition to the network infrastructure, the event also required a comprehensive CCTV system to ensure the safety of attendees. To this end, at least one cherry picker equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera was stationed within each arena, with additional cameras installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication.\n\nTo aid in the deployment and management of the network, we utilized a number of tools and resources. For example, we used QGIS's 'Align Raster' tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map, which we then uploaded to Mapbox and used to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This map used the host phone's geolocation to position a marker, helping us to determine our exact location on the site and identify which tents required connectivity. We also used the 'Map Marker' app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them.\n\nAfter the event, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all of the equipment. This was particularly useful as the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, making it difficult to locate the devices without a detailed and up-to-date map showing their locations and connections. By using this map, we were able to efficiently trace faults in the network and ensure that all of the equipment was properly accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and complex endeavor that helped to ensure the smooth operation of the event."

          "content": "Inspired by the idea of using natural building materials, we set out to explore the unique characteristics and personalities of each material and use them in innovative ways in our design. We wanted to capture the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found, such as the underground world of stone and water or the airy heights of wood.\n\nTo this end, we experimented with lightweight hazel structures as a way to combine wood and air in our design. We were particularly interested in the underground world of stone and water, and decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide, and we had to come up with a different solution to support the roof of the tunnel. We ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above, which took up a lot of space and lost some of the rustic charm of our original design, but was necessary for safety.\n\nAccording to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer between the stone and wood in our design - a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. While we have not yet conducted extensive research on using mud as a building material, we have done extensive research and design work on the organic life that it can support. In our design, we envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, warm and dry in the loft, while the ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. There may also be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose.\n\nOverall, our goal in this project was to use natural building materials in unique and innovative ways that captured the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found. While we encountered some challenges along the way, the process was exciting and rewarding, and we are proud of the design we have created."

To identify suitable locations for outbuildings, we carefully evaluated the contour polygons and selected sites that were located on the highest ground available.\n\nOverall, the use of Digital Terrain Model LIDAR tiles and contour polygons was essential in helping us to accurately assess the flood risk of Pudding Brooke and identify suitable sites for outbuildings. By carefully analyzing the topography of the area, we were able to make informed decisions about where it was safe to build, ensuring that any new structures would be protected from potential flooding.\n\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/pudding-brook.jpg)"

With this system, the salad bar would be able to achieve perpetual harvesting, meeting its demand for fresh produce without having to rely on traditional terrestrial agriculture methods.\n\nIn addition to this innovative planting system, we also propose supplying the plants with dissolved nutrients by producing an ultrasonic fog in the chamber between the two planting surfaces. This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.\n\nOverall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce."

This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.\n\nThere are many different types of organisms that can be incorporated into the design of a building. Some examples might include microalgae, which can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production; vermiculture, which can be used for composting and soil improvement; fish, which can be used for food production and waste management; guinea pigs, which can be used for research and education; leafy green plants, which can be used for air purification and aesthetics; and bacteria, which can be used for biological processes such as fermentation and nutrient cycling.\n\nThe building itself should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms. By using environment-specific creatures, it is possible to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building. This approach allows for the creation of a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, providing numerous benefits to the occupants such as improved air quality, food production, and waste management. By considering the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we can design buildings that are more dynamic, self-sustaining, and supportive of human health and well-being."
