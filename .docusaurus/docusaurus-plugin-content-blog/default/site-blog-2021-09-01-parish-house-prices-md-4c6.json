  "title": "Parish House Prices - A Map of Average Sale Prices",
  "description": "In order to accurately assess the real estate market, our team utilized property sale data from the land registry and postal code data from the Ordnance Survey to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of each house sale. This data was then imported into a PostGIS database, where an SQL query was run to calculate the average home price for each parish. To facilitate the visualization and analysis of this information, we utilized the powerful mapping software QGIS. By coloring the polygons representing each parish based on the average price, we were able to clearly and intuitively display the variations in the housing market across the region.",
