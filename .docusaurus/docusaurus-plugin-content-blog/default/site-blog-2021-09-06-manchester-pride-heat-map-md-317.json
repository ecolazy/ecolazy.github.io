  "description": "As part of this deployment project, our team encountered a physically demanding challenge: the installation of two sectors on the 18th floor of a tower block adjacent to the event site. From this vantage point, we were able to transmit a strong signal to multiple wireless point-to-point stations attached to temporary structures and buildings within the site. Additionally, we provided indoor wireless coverage in an underground parking garage that served as one of the event venues. To ensure optimal coverage, we created a heat map of the wireless signal strength in this area. Moreover, we established uplinks at various locations throughout the site to support ticket booths, CCTV cameras, payment terminals for bars, a production office, and emergency liaison cabins. Overall, this comprehensive approach to wireless connectivity allowed for seamless communication and connectivity throughout the event.",
