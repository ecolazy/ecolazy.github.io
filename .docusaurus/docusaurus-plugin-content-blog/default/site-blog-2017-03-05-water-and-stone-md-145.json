  "title": "Designing a Living Building - An Organism with a Symbiotic Relationship with Its Occupants",
  "description": "When designing a building, it is important to consider the building as an organism that has a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.",
