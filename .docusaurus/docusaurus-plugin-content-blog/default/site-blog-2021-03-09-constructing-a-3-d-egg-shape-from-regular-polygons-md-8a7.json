  "description": "As engineers and designers, we are often approached with unusual and challenging requests. One such request came from an artist who asked us to help find a suitable geometry for a large egg sculpture. Intrigued by the opportunity to collaborate with an artist and apply our skills in a creative context, we set out to identify possible geometries using generative algorithms in Grasshopper 3D.",
