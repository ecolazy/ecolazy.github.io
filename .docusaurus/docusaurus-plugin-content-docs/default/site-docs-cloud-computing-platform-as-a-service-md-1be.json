  "description": "PaaS stands for \"Platform as a Service.\" It refers to a cloud computing model in which an organization develops and deploys applications on a cloud-based platform provided by a third-party provider. The provider manages the infrastructure and middleware required to support the applications, allowing the organization to focus on developing and deploying the applications. The organization pays for the platform on a pay-as-you-go basis, typically based on the resources consumed by the applications.",
