I wanted to sense the mood of these places. Through experimenting with lightweight hazel structures, I gained a better understanding of the combination of wood and air. This sparked my curiosity about the mysterious subterranean realm of stone and water. Consequently, I decided to embark on the adventure of excavating a tunnel into the hillside to explore further. Although my hope was to discover a natural cave, the largest cavity I found was disappointingly small."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Despite the challenges and moments of fear, the process was enjoyable, and it felt like a genuine adventure. To support the tunnel's roof, we eventually constructed concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels. However, this construction compromised the rustic charm of the tunnel, transforming it into a dark concrete duct and reducing the available space."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Between the layers of wood and stone, my cross-sectional diagram suggested a third layer: a thin stratum of mud, the source of all life.

Finally, I envisioned subterranean stone cavernous spaces beneath the building, their purpose yet to be determined."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
