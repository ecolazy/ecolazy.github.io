To give these flows a tangible 3D form, I calculated the relative sizes of their components, which often have unique scaling ratios influenced by their arrangement.\\n\\nAlthough the exact 3D arrangement of components has not been defined yet, we can still proceed with rough rules of thumb to scale the parts relative to one another. With these parts scaled between 2D and 3D, we can start crafting 3D conceptual designs. These designs are then subject to aesthetic and ergonomic considerations before entering a feedback loop for detailed analytical predictions of their behavior. Alternatively, we can directly proceed to working models, experimenting with suitable materials to assess their structural and aesthetic properties."},{"id":"looking-at-nature","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/looking-at-nature","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2023-07-27-looking-at-nature.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-27-looking-at-nature.md","title":"Harmony of Natural Building Materials - A Journey of Exploration and Inspiration","description":"The inspiration for my design approach came from a desire to work with natural building materials.

To determine the right placement, I looked at where these materials were naturally found in the landscape.\\n\\nIn an idealized cross-section of the landscape, stone was predominantly underground, often found in association with water, while wood was abundant on the surface and high in the air. I wanted to sense the mood of these places. Through experimenting with lightweight hazel structures, I gained a better understanding of the combination of wood and air. This sparked my curiosity about the mysterious subterranean realm of stone and water. Consequently, I decided to embark on the adventure of excavating a tunnel into the hillside to explore further. Although my hope was to discover a natural cave, the largest cavity I found was disappointingly small.\\n\\nDespite the challenges and moments of fear, the process was enjoyable, and it felt like a genuine adventure. To support the tunnel\'s roof, we eventually constructed concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels. However, this construction compromised the rustic charm of the tunnel, transforming it into a dark concrete duct and reducing the available space.\\n\\nBetween the layers of wood and stone, my cross-sectional diagram suggested a third layer: a thin stratum of mud, the source of all life. While I had not thoroughly researched mud as a construction material like the others, I extensively studied its role in supporting organic life. These findings are detailed in the whole design section.\\n\\nThe light and airy nature of wood led me to envision it as suitable for the sleeping quarters of the building, providing a dry and warm loft area. The middle layer, the ground floor, would accommodate activities related to daily living, including the kitchen, toilet, and spaces for organic activities and food production. Finally, I envisioned subterranean stone cavernous spaces beneath the building, their purpose yet to be determined."},{"id":"infinite-universe","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/infinite-universe","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2023-07-05-infinite-universe.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-05-infinite-universe.md","title":"Infinite Universe Illusion - A Method of Immersive Visual Effects Using LED Light Strips and Optical Materials","description":"Docusaurus Plushie","date":"2023-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":4.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ecolazy","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://ecolazy.github.io","key":"ecolazy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"infinite-universe","title":"Infinite Universe Illusion - A Method of Immersive Visual Effects Using LED Light Strips and Optical Materials","authors":"ecolazy","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Harmony of Natural Building Materials - A Journey of Exploration and Inspiration","permalink":"/blog/looking-at-nature"},"nextItem":{"title":"INSPIRE Index Polygon House Prices - A Map of Average Sale Prices","permalink":"/blog/inspire-index-polygon-house-prices"}},"content":"![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ms-3.png)\\n\\n## Method of Creating an Illusion for an Infinite Universe Utilizing LED Light Strips, Acrylic Sheets, Mirror Film, Half Mirror Film, and Dichroic Film\\n\\n## Field of the Invention\\nThe present invention relates to the field of visual effects and illusion creation, specifically pertaining to a method that employs LED light strips, acrylic sheets, mirror film, half mirror film, and dichroic film to generate an immersive illusion of an infinite universe.\\n\\n## Background\\nVisual effects and illusions have long fascinated individuals, resulting in the development of various techniques and devices to engage and captivate viewers.

The present invention addresses this need by combining specific components in a unique arrangement to achieve a visually stunning illusion.\\n\\n## Objective \\nThe invention aims to provide a method for creating an illusion of an infinite universe. By meticulously arranging and utilizing LED light strips, acrylic sheets, mirror film, half mirror film, and dichroic film, the invention produces a captivating visual experience that simulates an expansive cosmic environment.\\n\\n## Statements of Invention \\nThe invention comprises the following components and their respective functions:\\nLayer 1: Optical Acrylic with LED Light Strip This layer consists of an optical-grade acrylic sheet featuring an integrated LED light strip running along one edge. The acrylic sheet is designed to possess optimal light reflection and transmission properties. The LED light strip illuminates the acrylic sheet, generating a radiant and uniform distribution of light.\\n\\nLayer 2: Mirror Film with Star-Shaped Holes The second layer incorporates a mirror film with strategically positioned star-shaped holes on the front face of the acrylic sheet. These apertures enable light to escape in a diffused manner, emulating the appearance of stars. The mirror film enhances the reflective properties, amplifying the impact of the illusion.\\n\\nLayer 3: Dichroic Film The third layer involves the integration of a dichroic film renowned for its ability to selectively reflect and transmit specific wavelengths of light. This film introduces vibrant colors and dynamic effects to the illusion, causing the stars to exhibit various hues.\\n\\nLayer 4: Acrylic Sheet with 20% Transmissivity Mirror Coating The fourth layer encompasses another acrylic sheet coated with a mirror coating, allowing approximately 20% of light transmission. This semi-transparent mirror coating permits the perception of both reflected and partially transmitted light, contributing to the depth and complexity of the illusion while immersing the viewer in an expansive visual landscape.\\n\\n## Description of Examples\\nThe invention operates as follows: The LED light strip situated along the edge of the optical acrylic sheet provides uniform illumination across its surface.

One of my greatest influences is my great grandfather, Sir Ove Arup, whose legacy profoundly impacted me. Witnessing the thin shell structures featured in the Arup Journal ignited my fascination for these architectural marvels. Building countless woven hazel frames further deepened my appreciation for unique structures, and I also explored traditional wooden boat building, captivated by the artistry of the craft.\\n\\nDriven by the dream of building my own home on a piece of land in the garden, I drew inspiration from Lloyd Kahn\'s book, \\"Shelter.\\" With friends, we embarked on the ambitious project of excavating a 14-meter long tunnel into the hillside, using stones sourced from the garden. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete to ensure stability, transforming our vision into a reality.\\n\\nRecognizing the significance of understanding materials in architecture, I pursued hands-on experience. I attended a year-long course in fine joinery and followed it with a two-year apprenticeship in stone masonry. Additionally, I explored steel fabrication through a separate course, expanding my skills and knowledge.\\n\\nMy interest in aquaponics and domestic food production led me to extensive research on ecological system engineering, particularly the work of the New Alchemy Institute. Spirulina, a microalgae with exceptional nutritional benefits, intrigued me, and I explored ways to integrate photo bioreactors into buildings for sustainable food production.\\n\\nThrough creative exploration, I used SketchUp to document the construction of a pottery shed, and together with friends, we built an oak-framed building set into the hillside over the course of a year. My passion for boats led me to collaborate with a Canadian theatre company, contributing to ship repairs and creating scene-by-scene drawings for rigging procedures.\\n\\nSeeking a deeper understanding of building technologies and structural elements, I established a personal studio. Utilizing color-coded material selection charts and exploring form-finding software, computational geometry, and fabric formed plaster, I created physical models of various structures. Additionally, I delved into technologies for energy efficiency and cost reduction in building materials.\\n\\nAlthough I have enjoyed working as a part-time stonemason, I am eager to further expand my knowledge through a university education. My interest lies in understanding the functional technologies of buildings before exploring sociological and aesthetic considerations, ultimately shaping my future architectural practice.\\n\\nCurrently, I have two distinct streams of interest: thin shell structures, inspired by my great grandfather\'s work and my experiences with woven hazel branches, and a broader fascination with arranging elements efficiently to meet occupants\' needs with minimal energy consumption, influenced by figures like Buckminster Fuller and principles of permaculture. I am in the process of organizing my research into meaningful forms, creating interconnected systems maps, and quantifying their relationships. My vision is to design buildings that embody these innovative approaches.\\n\\nMy passion lies in researching green building technologies, delving into the intricate physics of these systems. As I grasp the fundamental workings intuitively, I enjoy creating diagrams that visually represent the technology in an accessible manner. Using color-coded material property charts, I enhance my understanding and allow myself to explore this information imaginatively.\\n\\nCrafting pictorial flow diagrams that document the fusion and evolution of design concepts brings me great joy. These diagrams become a web of interconnected ideas, from which intriguing concepts can be extracted and expanded into three-dimensional forms. This transformative process involves further refinements and adjustments to create refined designs.\\n\\nThe most captivating aspect of this functional design process is the emergence of peculiar aesthetics. Beyond mere functionality, the creations exude a unique and striking visual appeal. An example of such a conceptual autonomous building is depicted here, born from this very design process. This building features a magnificent piece of parabolically curved stainless steel with a dual purpose. Firstly, it collects rainwater, and secondly, it concentrates all rooftop solar irradiance into a single sheet of brilliant light. As this radiant light passes through the center of the building, it illuminates and energizes the interior rooms. Finally, it proceeds to the basement, where it gently heats a substantial volume of water and supports various waste treatment bioreactors."},{"id":"flood-risk-assessment-of-pudding-brook","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/flood-risk-assessment-of-pudding-brook","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2022-03-05-flood-risk-assessment-of-pudding-brook copy.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-05-flood-risk-assessment-of-pudding-brook copy.md","title":"Flood Risk Assessment of Pudding Brooke - Utilizing Topography Analysis for Informed Decision Making","description":"To comprehensively assess the flood risk of Pudding Brooke, we employed Digital Terrain Model LIDAR tiles in QGIS to generate contour polygons at 0.25m intervals.

However, harnessing and concentrating solar energy efficiently remains a challenge in widespread adoption.\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\nThis paper introduces a groundbreaking solar concentrator that utilizes a spherical structure adorned with rotating mirrors to effectively concentrate solar energy. The sphere is covered with a multitude of small mirrors, each with the freedom to rotate in any direction. As sunlight approaches the sphere from various angles, the mirrors reflect the light towards the center of the sphere, leading to concentrated solar energy that can be utilized for electricity generation or water heating.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe solar concentrator comprises three key elements: a sphere, an array of small mirrors, and a robust support structure. The sphere\'s surface is adorned with numerous small mirrors, all capable of independent rotation. The support structure ensures the sphere remains in a fixed position while offering necessary stability.\\n\\nThe small mirrors can be crafted from reflective materials like glass, metal, or plastic, while the support structure must possess the strength to bear the sphere\'s weight and endure prolonged sun exposure.\\n\\n## Utilization\\n\\nThe versatile solar concentrator can be harnessed for two primary purposes: electricity generation and water heating. In electricity generation, the concentrated solar energy heats a fluid (e.g., water or molten salt), which, in turn, powers a turbine to produce electricity. For water heating, the solar energy directly heats the water, providing a sustainable solution for various daily needs.\\n\\n## Advantages\\n\\nThe innovation of employing a sphere with rotating mirrors endows the solar concentrator with numerous advantages. Firstly, the rotating mirrors efficiently capture sunlight from diverse angles, heightening its solar energy absorption. Secondly, these mirrors effectively concentrate the sunlight into a confined area, maximizing electricity generation or water heating efficiency. Lastly, the simplicity in manufacturing and installation renders it a cost-effective solution for solar energy applications.\\n\\n## Claims\\n\\nThe solar concentrator features:\\n- A spherical structure\\n- A set of small mirrors\\n- A sturdy support structure\\n\\nThe small mirrors are positioned across the sphere, each with free rotation capability.\\n\\nThe support structure ensures the sphere\'s stability and resilience to sunlight-induced corrosion.\\n\\nThe solar concentrator can generate electricity.\\n\\nThe solar concentrator can heat water.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe revolutionary spherical solar concentrator presents an efficient approach to capture and concentrate solar energy. Its distinctive features, including the ability to reflect sunlight from various angles, concentrate energy effectively, and cost-effective production and implementation, position it as a promising option for solar energy applications."},{"id":"truss-connection-node-modeling","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/truss-connection-node-modeling","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2021-03-04-truss-connection-node-modeling.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-04-truss-connection-node-modeling.md","title":"Innovative Dodecahedron Structural Node - Enhancing Truss Flexibility and Strength","description":"Docusaurus Plushie","date":"2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 4, 2021","tags":[{"label":"hola","permalink":"/blog/tags/hola"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":1.24,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ecolazy","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://ecolazy.github.io","key":"ecolazy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"truss-connection-node-modeling","title":"Innovative Dodecahedron Structural Node - Enhancing Truss Flexibility and Strength","authors":"ecolazy","tags":["hola","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Advancing Solar Concentration with a Spherical Solar Concentrator","permalink":"/blog/modeling-a-spherical-solar-concentrator"},"nextItem":{"title":"Creating 3D Buildings from Mastermap with QGIS","permalink":"/blog/creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis"}},"content":"![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-3.png)\\n\\n\\nIn this project, our objective was to design and fabricate a unique dodecahedron-shaped structural node to be utilized in a truss system. Trusses are vital components in structural engineering, consisting of interconnected struts that work collaboratively to evenly distribute loads, ensuring the stability and strength of the overall structure. Our innovative node boasted 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was connected to the center of one of these faces using a single bolt. The bolt passed through a hole in the center of the strut\'s end cap and was securely fastened by screwing it into a threaded hole located at the center of the dodecahedron face.\\n\\nFabricated from sturdy steel, our node was expertly designed to withstand the forces transmitted through the truss. Its dodecahedron shape and the single-bolt connection for each strut granted an impressive level of flexibility and adaptability. The modularity of the design allowed for easy rearrangement or removal of the struts, a critical feature that significantly contributed to the overall truss system\'s versatility. The node became an essential element in the truss design, enabling swift modifications to meet changing needs and requirements.\\n\\nOverall, the dodecahedron-shaped structural node we created proved to be an effective and efficient solution for joining multiple truss struts at a single point. Its paramount role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the truss\'s stability and strength, combined with its modular design, ensured the structure\'s adaptability, making it a remarkable achievement in structural engineering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-2.jpg)"},{"id":"creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2021-02-02-creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-02-creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis.md","title":"Creating 3D Buildings from Mastermap with QGIS","description":"The Ordnance Survey Mastermap Topography Layer, Building Height Attribute (BHA), and Environment Agency LiDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) are valuable data sources that enable the creation of 3D models of buildings.

The stage needed to meet several requirements: it had to have a 6-meter diameter, be easily disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a 2.6-meter-wide door, support the weight of performers, be quickly assembled by two people (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), remain flat and level on rough terrain, and withstand the rough handling and moisture typically encountered in circus life.\\n\\nTo achieve these goals, we explored various designs for the circular stage and ultimately settled on a composite panel construction. Each panel was made with an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fiberglass, coated with a non-slip surface. The material was shaped using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam from the mating edges was removed, leaving only the outer fiberglass material. Aluminum extrusions were then pressed into the edges of the panels, providing protection, supporting the edges to prevent deflection, and creating slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.\\n\\nThe leg structures were positioned at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels, welded at 120-degree intervals to form a three-directional cross. A threaded tube was left at the intersection, into which a bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom could be threaded. This allowed for easy adjustment of the legs from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. The quick and simple assembly process involved extending the legs until they touched the ground to level the stage. Inner steel box sections curved along the outer edges of the panels held the pieces together, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.\\n\\nOverall, the design and construction of the circular stage were challenging yet rewarding. We successfully met all the client\'s requirements, creating a durable, stable, and easily assembled stage that could withstand the demands of circus performances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-7.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-8.jpg)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-2.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-6.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-10.jpg)"},{"id":"provisioning-cisco-cloud-wireless-controller","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/provisioning-cisco-cloud-wireless-controller","editUrl":"https://github.com/ecolazy/blog/2020-03-06-provisioning-cisco-cloud-wireless-controller.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-03-06-provisioning-cisco-cloud-wireless-controller.md","title":"Provisioning Cisco Cloud Wireless Controller","description":"In this project, our aim was to successfully install and configure the Cisco Catalyst c9800-CL wireless controller using Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

These cabinets were further linked to multiple bonded ADSL connections, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.\\n\\nTo extend connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were positioned within 100 meters of the cabinets. Areas beyond this range were connected using wireless point-to-point links, mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beamed across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. At distant locations, wireless point-to-point receivers were attached to the sides of tents to capture these signals.\\n\\nBesides the network infrastructure, a comprehensive CCTV system was crucial for ensuring attendee safety. To achieve this, each arena was equipped with at least one cherry picker, hosting a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera. Additional cameras were installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, while temporary offices were equipped with WiFi and VoIP phones for efficient internal and external communication.\\n\\nTo facilitate the deployment and management of the network, we employed various tools and resources. For instance, we utilized QGIS\'s \'Align Raster\' tool to georeference a high-definition site map image, which was then uploaded to Mapbox to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This web map utilized the host phone\'s geolocation to position markers, aiding in identifying the exact location of tents requiring connectivity. We also utilized the \'Map Marker\' app on Android to rapidly locate and deploy network devices.\\n\\nAfter the event, the map proved invaluable in locating and retrieving all equipment. This was especially helpful as the staff members responsible for investigating faults or retrieving hardware were often different from those who deployed them, making it challenging to locate devices without an updated map showing their precise locations and connections.

This groundbreaking method employs a specially designed keeder rail that revolutionizes the process.\\n\\nThe keeder rail is ingeniously crafted to accommodate a cylindrical metal piece, featuring a strategically drilled threaded hole perpendicular to its length. Securing this metal piece in place is effortless, thanks to a large, flat disk with a threaded hole at its center. A simple turn of the disk firmly locks the metal piece, providing a reliable foundation for the installation.\\n\\nA vital element of this system is the pipe clamp, precisely tailored to fit standard aluminum poles. Utilizing two clamps per pole, we ensure the poles are securely anchored vertically on the side of the tent. This innovative approach guarantees stable connectivity throughout events, without compromising the marquees\' aesthetic integrity.\\n\\nWith this hardware design, we aim to enhance wireless connectivity in outdoor settings, providing seamless and secure communication during various events while seamlessly blending with the overall marquee aesthetics. Our cutting-edge solution opens new possibilities for event organizers, ensuring a reliable and visually pleasing wireless experience for attendees.\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/clamp-2.jpg)\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/clamp-3.jpg)"}]}')}}]);
