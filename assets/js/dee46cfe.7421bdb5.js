This was especially helpful as the staff members responsible for investigating faults or retrieving hardware were often different from those who deployed them, making it challenging to locate devices without an updated map showing their precise locations and connections. By utilizing this map, we efficiently traced faults in the network and ensured that all equipment was accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and intricate endeavor, contributing to the smooth operation of the event."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
